Create a functioning password generator with numbers, letters and symbols with JavaScript


### HW 2 â€“ Javascript Password Generator

I have put together the code to make a working password generator with the use of number, letters and a selection of symbols to create a secure password. When the button is clicked prompts will ask for you password length, preference on character type and a password will be generated at the end. 


### Impressions

Getting through this assignment was definitely a challenge and took a lot of research to make all of the pieces match up. I also utilized the brain power and eye for detail of some of my cohorts to assist in problem solving and sharing solutions, which I found extremely helpful. While my code is not perfect I think I have a decently working product that could be effective with some tweaks.
